I am a Ph.D. student under the supervision of [Olivier Simonin](http://perso.citi-lab.fr/osimonin/) (CITI Lab, INSA Lyon), [Isabelle Guerin-Lassous](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/isabelle.guerin-lassous/) (LIP, ENS Lyon) and [Isabelle Fantoni](https://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/~fantoni-i/index.html) (LS2N, CNRS).

I research communication in groups of cooperative aerial robots, or fleets of drones. My Ph.D. subject is **Efficient control of UAV fleet subject to heterogeneous communication constraints**. 

More specifically, we aim at improving the co-habitation of different flows of information with contrasting Quality of Service (QoS) requirements in a group of flying robots (e.g. *piloting data flow* and *video streaming flow*). We focus our efforts towards the Wi-Fi technology for now, but other physical layers could be considered in the future. To investigate the open problems and challenges, we use both **simulation** and **real-life experiments**.

My research interest include *robotics* (in particular multi-robot systems), *ad-hoc networks* and *cyber-physical systems simulation*.
