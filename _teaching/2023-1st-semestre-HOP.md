I gave a practical class on antennas to 3rd year engineering students at INSA Lyon, department telecommunications.

This class is about radiation patterns and polarization for antennas. In simulation using the free software [EZNEC](https://eznec.com/ez70manual.html) (a *Numerical Electromagnetic Code* software that solves Maxwell's equations), we generated radiation patterns for simple wire antennas of different sizes and source positions. 

We also used an electric field measure tool to give the students a grasp on everyday's electro-magnetic radiations (around a running microwave, a smartphone, earbuds, or a preconfigured USRP with antenna).

The subject for this practical work was written by [Claire GOURSAUD](https://team.inria.fr/maracas/team-members/claire-goursaud/).
